On my Mac i already use GnuPG a lot (basically all my messages are signed, and some of them
encrypted). But because nowadays i do a good amount of work on my iPad an iPhone, is had to
search for a GnuPG solution on iOS too.

# Clients

|   | Name | Price |
|---|------|---|
| ![iPGMail Icon](ipgmail_icon.png) | [iPGMail](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/ipgmail/id430780873?mt=8) | 1,79 EUR |
| ![oPenGP Icon](opengp_icon.png) | <s>oPenGP</s> | 4,49 EUR |
| ![Secumail Icon](secumail_icon.jpg) | <s>Secumail</s> | 44,99 EUR |
| ![NouveauPG Icon](nouveaupg_icon.png) | <s>NouveauPG</s> | 2,69 EUR |

All programs where tested on iOS 8.1.2 with a iPhone 6 and a iPad Mini Retina. All programs
except NouveauPG are Universal Apps and optimized fordifferent screen sizes.

# Test Matrix

the programs where tested against this test matrix. I started at the top and proceeded
to the bottom. Secumail and NouveauPG are disqualified, because it is not possible to
exchange the private Key over iTunes, and you should never copy your private key to
a Cloud Storage (even with a good passphrase).

For the remaining programs i have tested if the functionality works, and then got my own
opinion if the integration in iOS is felicitous.

# Conclusions

The usage of GnuPG on the iPhone is not as usable as on other devices. It works with some
hassle, but for a widespread use of GnuPG on iOS, Apple has to allow plugins in the
iOS Mail program.

In my opinion, the cheapest App (iPGMail) is the way to go.

# Recommendations

- Always use iTunes for Key transfer (not Dropbox or iCloud)
- Do not generate your key pair on the iPhone (unknown RNG)

# How to use iPGMail

## Copy your private Key

![Export Keys](export_01.png)

Find the key to export to the iPhone.

![Export Keys](export_02.png)

Select Export (Exportieren in german language).

Do not forget to export your private key too (Geheimer Schl√ºssel in german language).

![Import Keys](import_01.png)

In the Apps Section you have to completely scroll down until you see the section where you can copy
files to the iPhone/iPad. There you have to select iPGMail and click add (Hinzuf&uuml;gen in
german Language).

## Sending a signed and encryted EMail

![Send encrypted EMail](send_01.png)

Start iPGMail and go to the compose tab. You can select a key which is used for signing
(your own key) and a public key for encryption (the public receiver key). Then you can type
your subject and your message. After that, click on the send icon in the upper right corner.

Select "Send EMail" for creating a EMail directly.

The receiver is picked up from the public key you haven chosen before. **Send**.
