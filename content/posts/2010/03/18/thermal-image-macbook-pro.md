We had a Thermal Image Photosession for our home last week. I have also 
made an Thermal Image of my Macbook Pro.

Now i know, why my legs feel hot while working with my Mac ;). The Power Supply
is getting hot too... The colors are not scaled to the same temperatures
(see the temperature bar at the bottom with min and max temperature).
