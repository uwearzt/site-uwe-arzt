<s>Parallella</s> has started a distributed Supercomputer on
<s>supercomputer.io</s> with their parallela chips. I decided to
put my two Kickstarter Parallelas inside a cooling case and let them participate.

If you like to build your own, you can print the STL files

* [Air Channel](AirChannel.stl)
* [Standoff](Standoff.stl) (4 times)

or you can get the CAD files from <s>Onshape</s> and change it according to your needs.
