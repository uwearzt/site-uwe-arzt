I've got my two [Parallela](http://www.parallella.org) Boards from the [Parallella Kickstarter Campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adapteva/parallella-a-supercomputer-for-everyone).

So far i have only installed Ubuntu on the two boards and run some sample programs. Looks like they have quite impressive performance.
