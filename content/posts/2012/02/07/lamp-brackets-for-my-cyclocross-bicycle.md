**Update
The drawings are now available online, see my [blogpost](/2015/09/16/redrawn-bicycle-parts-in-onshape/).
Update**

My new cyclocross bicycle needed lighting, because it is used everyday for my way to work.
It is equipped with a hub dynamo but does not have mounting holes for lights.

Because i did not find anything useful, i created my own lamp brackets.
