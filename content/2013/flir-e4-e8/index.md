I have bought a FLIR E4 Thermal Camera and Firmware upgraded it to a E8. Very nice Thermal camera. I will use it to test my currently build Reflow Oven,
and have some other fun with it (What about IR Skype?).

One nice feature is that you get a standard photo together with the thermal image:

And BTW my printer is sucking to much energy...
